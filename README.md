Project Description: Bubble Kraze
  The object of the game is to remove all the bubbles before time runs out. The way to make the remove the bubbles is by shooting a ball towards other same colored balls that are next to each other. Once you get three of the same colored bubbles in a row, they will disappear. The tank is what you shoot the bullets from and it will be located in the bottom center of the screen. The balls will appear at the top of the screen and the colors will be chosen at random. The bubbles grid consists of. Every minute, another row appears from the top of the bottom. When you shoot the bullets from the tank, you can bounce them off the wall to hit your target. Once you get three balls of the same color touching, they will disappear. If you hit the bullet and it is not next to two other balls of the same color, then the bullet will just stay next to where you shot it. 
	Depending on how many bubbles you got to disappear and how fast you do it, will change your score. The more bubbles you make disappear and the faster you do it, the higher the score. 
	This game is similar to Bubble Mania. In Bubble Mania, you throw bubbles out of a cannon and match colors to pop the bubbles. When you pop all the bubbles in time, you advance to the next level. Each 30 seconds, a new row of bubbles appears at the top of the screen shifting down the old row of bubbles and so on. There are many different power ups such as the bomb bubble which when lands, destroys all surrounding bubbles. 
Once you win, you get a big hug from the Bubble Mania Creators team (especially Alex Wu).
